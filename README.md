Melboure Housing
INTRODUCTIONÂ¶
Melbourne Housing Project Using this data create a model (Linear Regression) to predict a house's value. We want to be able to understand what creates value in a house, as though we were a real estate developer. The project should follow the guideline as:
Examine and explore data (visualization, interactions among features)
Apply the model for prediction with holdout and cross validation
Using PCA, apply the model with holdout and cross validation
Visualize the residue and homoscedasticity
Tune the model if necessary
Write up analysis for each section (for example, explain why the model is overfitting, explain why applying PCA is better, etc.)
Include conclusions for summary
